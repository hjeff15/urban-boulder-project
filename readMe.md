TO DO LIST

1. Custom MongoDB custome aggregations to look for crags near me
2. Redo the css and Request New Password email (currently 'borrowed' from Wesbos Node course...)
3. Lockdown permissions for editing server-side. ConfirmUser func pre-exports.updateCrag???
4. Lockdown msg, maybe make them an array to map over. Currently only has space for one user error at a time.
5. Add an HTML stripper on the server side to ensure no XSS (cross-site-scripting) attack. Maybe use domPurify or striptags? (See vid 30/wes/node)
