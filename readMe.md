# **The Urban Boulder Project**

## What Is The UBP?

---

The Urban Boulder Project 'UBP' is an experimental database that has grown out of the need to find crags
closer to home during the 2020 pandemic. As the world shut down its borders many of us struggled
to find a way of staying fit, motivated and inspired. However, climbers have found that it only took a
small leap of imagination to see that there where plenty of things to climb a mere stones throw from their own
doorstep. You just had to know where they were.
The term 'Buildering' has been around for a while. A pretty esoteric term if ever there was one, but the
practise has come into its own, and it seems fitting that there should be a place where climbers can share it all.

## How does it work?

---

Users are free to browse all the crags added and use the map to find what is local to you. However, if you feel like you have something to share, be it a new crag or make a comment and give the your opinion on the grade, or just give the
place a thumbs-up, then you will need to register as a UBP user and login to do so. If there is something you
feel we could do to improve this please do let us know by contacting us using the link at the bottom of this page.

## What's In The Pipeline?

---

This really depends on if this service is being used. If there is some enthusiasm about the project then it would
be great to develop the site to incorporate things like in-app messaging, recommended user-circuits, more
space for photo uploads and individual boulder problems. But we will have to see if and how the site is used.

## Build Status

---

Still in alpha. There's a few elements that need shifting when viewed on mobile.
