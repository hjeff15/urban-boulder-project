TO DO LIST

<!-- 1. Custom MongoDB custome aggregations to look for crags near me -->

<!-- 2. Redo the css and Request New Password email (currently 'borrowed' from Wesbos Node course...) -->

<!-- 3. Lockdown permissions for editing server-side. ConfirmUser func pre-exports.updateCrag?? -->
 <!-- 4. Lockdown state = msg, maybe make them an array to map over. Currently only has space for one user error/msg at a time. -->

<!-- 4. Add an HTML stripper on the server side to ensure no XSS (cross-site-scripting) attack. Maybe use domPurify or striptags? (See vid 30/wes/node) -->

5. **IMPORTANT** Make sure to limit the google api key to the final domain name used (post Deploy?)
 <!-- 7. Implement timer on local storage login details...? -->

<!-- 6. Add routes to crag, route range (V3-v8 etc.), number of routes. -->
<!-- 8. Update 'isAuth' func to use the isAuthenticated() method??? -->
<!-- 10. Make function for '...' at the end of description and title of crags on Crag Card. -->

<!-- 6. Add res msg from comment to 'Comment added' box above Comment box. -->

7. Pagination
 <!-- 11. Add Tooltip to lat and lng (why we ask for this...) -->
8. Add React-helmet or see other way to engage SEO
9. Change MailTrap to MailChimp or other...
10. What the hell is happening after creating new crag?? (showCrag seems to rerender?.....)
