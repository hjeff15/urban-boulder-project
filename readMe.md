TO DO LIST

<!-- 1. Custom MongoDB custome aggregations to look for crags near me -->

2. Redo the css and Request New Password email (currently 'borrowed' from Wesbos Node course...)
3. Lockdown permissions for editing server-side. ConfirmUser func pre-exports.updateCrag???
4. Lockdown state = msg, maybe make them an array to map over. Currently only has space for one user error/msg at a time.
5. Add an HTML stripper on the server side to ensure no XSS (cross-site-scripting) attack. Maybe use domPurify or striptags? (See vid 30/wes/node)
6. **IMPORTANT** Make sure to limit the google api key to the final domain name used.
7. Implement timer on local storage login details...?
8. Add routes to crag, route range (V3-v8 etc.), number of routes.
9. Update 'isAuth' func to use the isAuthenticated() method???
10. Make function for '...' at the end of description and title of crags on Crag Card.
'\***\*\*\*\*\***\*\*\*\*\***\*\*\*\*\***'
<!-- 11. Correct FormError componentn to active an error msg/state rather than render new component. -->
11. Change 'About' Form to 'Email Us' in order to get user feedback...,Add Footer and Contact Page?
12. Edit the 'Dasboard'
13. Pagination
